The login test failed because the Submit button was not clickable due to a loading spinner overlay obscuring it at coordinates (450, 600). The test attempted to click the Submit button before the loading spinner disappeared, resulting in an AssertionError during the form submission step.

## 2. ROOT CAUSE
**Test Flakiness / Timing Issue**

This is most likely a **race condition** caused by inadequate wait conditions in the test code. The loading spinner (`div#loading_spinner`) is still visible when the test attempts to interact with the Submit button, indicating:
- Missing or insufficient explicit wait for the spinner to disappear
- Possible recent UI changes that introduced async loading behavior
- The test may have previously passed due to timing luck rather than proper synchronization

## 3. SEVERITY
**MEDIUM**

**Justification:**
- Blocks regression testing for login functionality (critical user flow)
- Does not indicate a production bug—likely a test implementation issue
- Can be quickly resolved with proper wait conditions
- Not affecting end users, only CI/CD pipeline reliability

## 1. SUMMARY
The login test failed because the Submit button was not clickable due to a loading spinner overlay obscuring it at coordinates (450, 600). The test attempted to click the Submit button before the loading spinner disappeared, resulting in an AssertionError during the form submission step.

## 2. ROOT CAUSE
**Test Flakiness / Timing Issue**

This is most likely a **race condition** caused by inadequate wait conditions in the test code. The loading spinner (`div#loading_spinner`) is still visible when the test attempts to interact with the Submit button, indicating:
- Missing or insufficient explicit wait for the spinner to disappear
- Possible recent UI changes that introduced async loading behavior
- The test may have previously passed due to timing luck rather than proper synchronization

## 3. SEVERITY
**MEDIUM**

**Justification:**
- Blocks regression testing for login functionality (critical user flow)
- Does not indicate a production bug—likely a test implementation issue
- Can be quickly resolved with proper wait conditions
- Not affecting end users, only CI/CD pipeline reliability

## 4. RECOMMENDATION

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Add explicit wait** in `login_page.py:42` before clicking Submit:
   ```python
   wait.until(EC.invisibility_of_element_located((By.ID, 'loading_spinner')))
   wait.until(EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.ID, 'submit')))
   ```

2. **Verify recent changes**: Check if UI code recently added async loading behavior that wasn't accounted for in the page object

3. **Review test stability**: Run the test 10+ times locally to confirm the fix eliminates flakiness
